## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
pull down, make changes, save file, git, stage file (click the check), commit, pull, push 
```{r}
#campaign finance over election result by party and state 
#joining contributions and candidates together
table1 <- contributions %>%
inner_join(candidates, "cand_id") %>%
#through ID
  group_by(cand_id, cand_name, cand_party_affiliation) %>%
  mutate(totaltrans = sum(transaction_amt))
```

```{r}

```
